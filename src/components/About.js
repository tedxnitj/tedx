                        <p>TED is a nonpartisan nonprofit devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks. TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged, and today covers almost all topics — from science to business to global issues — in more than 110 languages. Meanwhile, independently run TEDx events help share ideas in communities around the world.</p></Fade>

                        <p>A TEDx event is a local gathering where live TED-like talks and performances are shared with the community. TEDx events are fully planned and coordinated independently, on a community-by-community basis. The content and design of each TEDx event is unique and developed independently, but all of them have features in common.</p></Zoom>

                        <p>We started off as a group of driven people to launch the TEDx community at our institute in October 2022. Today, we're a family of about 50 people working to provide a stage for ideas and stories from different fields to reach keen and curious minds. TEDxNITJalandhar is organised by a team of dynamic individuals who believe in the power of reverberation of ideas.</p></Fade>
